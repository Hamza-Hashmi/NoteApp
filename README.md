Notes taking Android App with MVVM Architecture is here. The main advantage of MVVM is that it decouples the code and makes the package structure easier to navigate.
The project is easier to maintain and new features can be added more quickly and easily. Sealed class is used in this project. Sealed classes allow us to create instances with different types, unlike Enums which restrict us to use the same type for all enum constants.

The app is built with the following Android components:
• MVVM Architecture
• Modern Splash Screen
• Room Database
• Hilt Dependency Injection
• Corountine Flow
• Kotlin Coroutines
• Sealed Class
